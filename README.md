**Project 7** : Implement a scoring model

## Project Description:

Create a supervised model to predict the potential default for credit reimbursement (with an imbalance dataset **>90% without default**)

* Try different imbalance management methods: 
  * Undersampling
  * SMOTE
  * Sample_Weights
  * Threshold Proba update
* Attempt with Bayesian Optimisation (not kept in final model, just done for studies purpose)
* Use Fbeta Scoring metric (optimize both Recall and Precision with relative importance of Recall) 
* Use SHAP for model interpretability 
* Create a Dashboard with Streamlit
* Create an API with Flash 

Dataset used : <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data'>Data home-credit-default-risk</a>

## Assessed Skills:

* Create a dashboard representing the modeling of the imbalanced data solution
* Write a methodology note to explain the modeling pattern
* Present the modeling solution orally 
* Deploy a model via an API online
* Use a versioning software to ensure model integration
